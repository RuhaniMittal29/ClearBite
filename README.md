## Inspiration

Teenagers worldwide face confidence issues due to acne, often stemming from dietary triggers that go unnoticed. We wanted to create a solution to empower individuals to identify and manage these triggers, promoting healthier skin and greater self-confidence.

## What it does

ClearBite is a personalized AI-powered assistant that helps users discover the dietary causes of their acne. By asking questions about your diet and providing step-by-step plans, ClearBite identifies potential triggers and suggests healthier alternatives to help you achieve clearer skin.

## How we built it

*Frontend*: Built using React, HTML, and CSS, we designed a clean and minimalist user interface that is intuitive and user-friendly. *AI Model: We fine-tuned the Mistral AI model (with 7 billion parameters) on a custom dataset curated from multiple research papers. These papers highlighted dietary triggers for acne and their possible replacements. Data cleaning and preprocessing were key to creating a high-quality dataset for fine-tuning. *Backend*: Using Flask, we developed an API to connect the Mistral AI model with our frontend. This seamless integration allowed users to interact with the AI for tailored advice.
